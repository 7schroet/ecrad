INTRODUCTION

This package contains the offline version of a radiation scheme
suitable for use in atmospheric weather and climate models.  The code
is designed to be extensible and flexible.  For example, the gas
optics, cloud optics and solver are completely separated (see
radiation/radiation_interface.F90 where they are called in sequence),
thereby facilitating future changes where different gas models or
solvers may be switched in and out independently. The offline code is
parallelized using OpenMP.

Five solvers are currently available:

1. The Monte Carlo Independent Column Approximation (McICA) of Pincus
et al. (2003). This is is a now widely used method for treating cloud
structure efficiently. The implementation in this package is more
efficient than the one currently operational in the ECMWF model, and
produces less noise in partially cloudy situations. Note that since
McICA is stocastic, individual flux profiles using McICA may differ
simply due to random variations in the sampling of the cloud field.

2. The Tripleclouds scheme of Shonk and Hogan (2008). This represents
cloud structure by dividing each layer into three regions, one clear
and two cloudy with different optical depth. It is somewhat slower
than McICA but does not generate noise.

3. The Speedy Algorithm for Radiative Transfer through Cloud Sides
(SPARTACUS) of Hogan et al. (JGR 2016). This is a method for
efficiently treating 3D radiative effects associated with clouds. It
uses the same differential equations proposed by Hogan and Shonk (JAS
2013), but solves them using a matrix exponential method that is much
more elegant than their method, and is also here extended to the
longwave (see Schaefer et al., JGR 2016).  It also incorporates the
Tripleclouds methodology of Shonk and Hogan (2008) to represent cloud
inhomogeneity.

4. A homogeneous (plane parallel) solver in which clouds are assumed
to fill the gridbox horizontally.  This is useful for computing
Independent Column Approximation benchmarks.

5. A "cloudless" solver if your focus is on clear skies.

One gas optics model is provided: the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model
for GCMs (RRTMG), the implementation being that from the ECMWF
Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The code is designed so that
other gas optics models could be added in future.


PACKAGE OVERVIEW

The subdirectories are as follows:

  radiation - the ecRad souce code; the radiation/CONVENTIONS file
       lists the programming conventions for this part of the code

  radsurf - source code for radiative transfer in complex surfaces
       such as vegetation and urban areas - this is UNDER DEVELOPMENT
       and is likely to be removed as these features will be put in a
       separate package

  ifsaux - source code providing a (sometimes dummy) IFS environment

  ifsrrtm - the IFS implementation of RRTMG

  utilities - source code for useful utilities, such as reading NetCDF
       files

  driver - the source code for the offline driver program

  ifs - source files from the IFS that are used to provide inputs to
        ecRad (but not used in this offline version)

  mod - where Fortran module files are written

  lib - where the static libraries are written

  bin - where the executable ecrad is written

  data - contains configuration data read at run-time

  test - test cases including Matlab code to plot the outputs

  include - automatically generated interface blocks for non-module routines


TO COMPILE

1. Ensure you have a reasonably recent Fortran compiler - it needs to
support modules with "contains" and "procedure" statements for
example.  Ensure you have the Fortran NetCDF library installed
(versions 3 or 4) and that the module file is compatible with your
Fortran compiler.

2. You can compile the code using 

  make PROFILE=<prof>

where <prof> is one of gfortran or pgi.  This will read the
system-specific configurations from the file Makefile_include.<prof>.
If you omit the PROFILE= option then gfortran will be assumed. If you
have a compiler other than gfortran or PGI Fortran then create such a
file for your compiler following the example in
Makefile_include.gfortran. Two additional profiles are provided,
"ecmwf" which builds on the gfortran profile and "uor" (University of
Reading) which is built on the "pgi" profile.

If the compile is successful then static libraries should appear in
the lib directory, and then the executable bin/ecrad.

3. To clean-up, type "make clean".  To build an unoptimized version
for debugging, you can do

  make PROFILE=<prof> DEBUG=1

or you can specifically override the variables in Makefile_include.<prof>
using, for example

  make PROFILE=<prof> OPTFLAGS=-O0 DEBUGFLAGS="-g -pg"

To compile in single precision add SINGLE_PRECISION=1 to the "make"
command line


TO TEST

The offline driver is run via

    ecrad <namelist.nam> <input_file.nc> <output_file.nc>

where the radiation scheme is configured using the Fortran namelist
<namelist.nam>, and the inputs and outputs are in NetCDF format.  

The "test/ifs" directory contains a pole-to-pole slice of
low-resolution IFS model data in a form to use as input to the offline
version of ecRad. It includes aerosols extracted from the CAMS
climatology used operationally in IFS Cycle 43R3. Typing "make test"
in this directory runs a number of configurations of ecRad described
in the Makefile. The Matlab script plot_ifs.m can be used to visualize
the results. The file "ecrad_meridian_default_out_REFERENCE.nc"
contains a reference version of the output file
"ecrad_meridian_default_out.nc" (case "a"), which you can compare to
be sure your compilation is working as expected.

The "test/i3rc" directory contains the 1D profile of the I3RC cumulus
test case used by Hogan et al. (2016). Typing "make test" in this
directory runs the various 1D and 3D configurations of ecRad. The
Matlab script plot_i3rc.m can then be used to visualize the results,
reproducing three of the figures from Hogan et al. (2016). Note that
you will need to ensure that a reasonably up-to-date version of the
"nco" tools are available and in your path.  This test involves
running the duplicate_profiles.sh script, which duplicates the single
profile in i3rc_mls_cumulus.nc, each with a different solar zenith
angle.

The "test/surface" directory contains tests of the surface tile types,
although this is under development and so nothing here is guaranteed
to work.

Alternatively, type "make test" in the top-level directory to run all
cases.

In addition to writing the output file, a file containing the
intermediate radiative properties of the atmosphere for each g-point
can be stored in radiative_properties.nc (edit the config namelist to
enable this), but note that the g-points have been reordered in
approximate order of optical depth if the SPARTACUS solver is chosen.
