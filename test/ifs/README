This directory contains "ecrad_meridian.nc", a pole-to-pole slice of
low-resolution IFS model data in a form to use as input to the offline
version of ecRad. It includes aerosols extracted from the CAMS
climatology used operationally in IFS Cycle 43R3.


Up to ecRad version 1.1.6, the file included a modification for Earth
curvature effects within the IFS such that the online radiation scheme
never sees a solar zenith angle greater than 90 degrees. However, it
is important to test the offline ecRad for such conditions, so from
version 1.1.7, the cos_solar_zenith_angle variable has been modified
to allow the sun to go below the horizon.  The original file is in
ecrad_meridian_ORIG.nc.

Typing "make" in this directory runs four configurations of ECRAD in a
configuration similar to forthcoming cycle 46R1:

  (a) default settings with McICA solver and Exp-Exp cloud overlap;

  (b) as "a" but with aerosols turned off;

  (c) as "a" but with Exp-Ran overlap;

  (d) as "d" but with the Tripleclouds solver;

  (e) as "a" but with longwave scattering (default since 46R1);

  (f) as "d" but with the SPARTACUS solver (explicit entrapment)

  (g) as "f" but with an older configuration of the SPARTACUS solver
    (maximum entrapment).

To run with a configuration similar to older cycle 43R3, type

   make CONFIG=configCY43R3.nam

The Matlab script plot_ifs.m and Python script plot_ifs.py can be used
to visualize the results. The file
"ecrad_meridian_default_out_REFERENCE.nc" contains a reference version
of the output file "ecrad_meridian_default_out.nc" (case "a" above),
which you can compare to be sure your compilation is working as
expected.

Note that the shortwave diagnosed cloud cover will be set to minus one
when the sun is below the horizon.
